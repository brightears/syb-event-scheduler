## Overview

The SYB Event Scheduler automates music changes across your Soundtrack zones. Instead of manually changing music at different times of day, you can schedule playlists or music schedules to play automatically.

### Key Concepts
- **Event**: A scheduled action to change music at a specific time
- **Zone**: A physical location/speaker system (e.g., Lobby, Restaurant, Pool)
- **Music Library**: The account whose playlists/schedules you want to use
- **Playlist**: A single collection of songs
- **Schedule**: A time-based rotation of different playlists throughout the day

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Access the Application
Navigate to: https://syb-event-scheduler.onrender.com

### Step 2: Navigate the Interface
The app has three main sections:
- **Events**: Create and manage scheduled music changes
- **Settings**: Configure music sources and manage zones
- **Logs**: Monitor execution history and troubleshoot issues

---

## Settings Page

Before creating events, you must configure your music source.

### Select Music Library
1. Go to **Settings**
2. Click **"Select music library"**
3. Choose which account's music you want to use
4. This determines what playlists/schedules are available

### Zone Management
Due to the large number of zones, use these efficient methods:

#### Load Zones by Account
1. Enter an Account ID in the "Load Zones by Account ID" box
2. Click **"Load Account Zones"**
3. This loads only that account's zones (avoiding timeouts)

#### Finding Account IDs
Account IDs can be found:
- In the music library dropdown list
- From your CSV file of accounts and zones
- Example: `QWNjb3VudCwsMWNqMTM3Ymp3MXMv`

### Cache Management
- **Refresh accounts**: Update the list of available accounts
- **Refresh zones**: Update the list of available zones
- **Clear cache**: Start fresh if data seems outdated

## Monitoring with Logs

The Logs page shows execution history and helps troubleshoot issues.

### What Logs Show
- **Timestamp**: When the scheduler ran
- **Events Triggered**: Which events were executed
- **Zone Updates**: Success/failure for each zone
- **Error Messages**: Details if something went wrong

### When to Check Logs
1. **After creating new events**: Verify they executed correctly
2. **Daily monitoring**: Morning check for overnight events
3. **Troubleshooting**: When music doesn't seem to be playing correctly
4. **Reporting**: Track music changes for management

### Reading Log Entries
```
‚úÖ Successful execution shows all zones updated
‚ö†Ô∏è Partial success shows some zones failed
‚ùå Failed execution shows error details
```

2. Try refreshing the library cache
3. Check if the account has any playlists

### Zones Not Loading

## Best Practices

1. **Name Events Clearly**: Use descriptive names that indicate purpose and location

4. **Document Zone IDs**: Keep a reference of commonly used zone IDs
